# color-palette-recognition
A machine learning project that uses k-means algorithm to find the color palette of a give image.

## Overview

- Uses TensorFlow.js for efficient matrix operations
- Produces consistent results for the same input image
- Operates in RGB color space
- Accepts custom cluster count (`k`)

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs
